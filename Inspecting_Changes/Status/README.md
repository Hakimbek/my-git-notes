# Git Status
The git status command is used to display the state of the repository and staging area. It allows us to see the tracked, untracked files and changes. This command will not show any commit records or information.

Mostly, it is used to display the state between **Git Add** and **Git commit** command. We can check whether the changes and files are tracked or not.

```
$ git status 
```
