# Git log
The advantage of a version control system is that it records changes. These records allow us to retrieve the data like commits, figuring out bugs, updates. But, all of this history will be useless if we cannot navigate it. At this point, we need the git log command.

Git log is a utility tool to review and read a history of everything that happens to a repository. Multiple options can be used with a git log to make history more specific.

Generally, the git log is a record of commits. A git log contains the following data:

- A commit hash, which is a 40 character checksum data generated by SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) algorithm. It is a unique number.
- Commit Author metadata: The information of authors such as author name and email.
- Commit Date metadata: It's a date timestamp for the time of the commit.
- Commit title/message: It is the overview of the commit given in the commit message.

## How to Exit the git log Command?
There may be a situation that occurs, you run the git log command, and you stuck there. You want to type or back to bash, but you can't. When you click the Enter key, it will navigate you to the older command until the end flag.

The solution to this problem is to press the q (Q for quit). It will quit you from the situation and back you to the command line. Now, you can perform any of the commands.

## Basic Git log
Git log command is one of the most usual commands of git. It is the most useful command for Git. Every time you need to check the history, you have to use the git log command. The basic git log command will display the most recent commits and the status of the head. It will use as:
```
$ git log  
```
The above command is listing all the recent commits. Each commit contains some unique sha-id, which is generated by the SHA algorithm. It also includes the date, time, author, and some additional details.

We can perform some action like scrolling, jumping, move, and quit on the command line. To scroll on the command line press k for moving up, j for moving down, the spacebar for scrolling down by a full page to scroll up by a page and q to quit from the command line.

## Git Log Oneline
The oneline option is used to display the output as one commit per line. It also shows the output in brief like the first seven characters of the commit SHA and the commit message.

It will be used as follows:
```
$ git log --oneline  
```
So, usually we can say that the --oneline flag causes git log to display:

- one commit per line
- the first seven characters of the SHA
- the commit message

## Git Log Stat
The log command displays the files that have been modified. It also shows the number of lines and a summary line of the total records that have been updated.

Generally, we can say that the stat option is used to display

- the modified files,
- The number of lines that have been added or removed
- A summary line of the total number of records changed
- The lines that have been added or removed.

It will be used as follows:
```
$ git log --stat  
```

## Git log P or Patch
The git log patch command displays the files that have been modified. It also shows the location of the added, removed, and updated lines.

It will be used as:
```
$ git log --patch  
```
Or
```
$ git log -p  
```
Generally, we can say that the --patch flag is used to display:

- Modified files
- The location of the lines that you added or removed
- Specific changes that have been made.

## Git Log Graph
Git log command allows viewing your git log as a graph. To list the commits in the form of a graph, run the git log command with --graph option. It will run as follows:
```
$ git log --graph  
```
To make the output more specific, you can combine this command with --oneline option. It will operate as follows:
```
$ git log --graph --oneline  
```
